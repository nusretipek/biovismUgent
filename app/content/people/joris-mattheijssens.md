description: <b> Joris Mattheijssens </b> is passionate about science since early childhood, I have been lucky to be involved in a wide range of research projects.  My eclectic professional trajectory lead me through the fields of fluid dynamics, text mining, recommenders systems and my current employment, computer vision and audio analysis.  I like to perform both computational work and experiments.  At the moment, I study the pollination of crops by insects and the social behaviour of pigs.  For this, I perform measurement campaigns and train machine learning models.  Furthermore, I teach math to first-year students in bioscience engineering.
