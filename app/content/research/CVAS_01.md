description: Previous research clearly showed the potential of video analysis and machine learning to study dairy cow behaviour. However, no long term study with the aim of collecting and analysing behavioural data of a commercial sized herd was yet executed. Therefore, we aim to develop a video analysis based monitoring system to study the behaviour dairy cows in an automated way. With this computer vision based pipeline, we will carry out a profound study of the behaviour of dairy cows in commercial herds, both in indoor and grazing conditions.
