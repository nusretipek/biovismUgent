description: The study of animal behaviour allow scientists to perceive the individual and social patterns. Although it is a rapidly growing area of study, the traditional approaches still predominate from collection of behavioural data to analysis of it. By creating automated pipelines and developing validation strategies for species under the focus, we aim to develop methodologies for characterisation of caged-animal behaviours. Application of state-of-art computer vision algorithms and integrating prior knowledge about the environmental knowledge, we build accurate and robust techniques from collection of data to knowledge extraction from it.
