description: Hybrid modelling of surface water systems using online sensor data is a technique used to model the behavior of surface water systems, such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, using real-time sensor data. The goal of this modelling technique is to create accurate and reliable models that can be used to make informed decisions about the management of these water systems. In this approach, the modelling process combines the use of physical models and data-driven models. Physical models use mathematical equations to describe the behavior of the water system, while data-driven models use statistical algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in the sensor data. By combining these two approaches, hybrid models can account for both the physical processes that govern the water system and the variations in real-time sensor data.
