category: hybrid
description: Hybrid modelling is a solution to bring forth the advantages of both mechanistic and data-driven models. The application of hybrid modelling in the domain of wastewater treatment has the potential to foster automation, increase efficiency, and increase the predictive power of models. The project aims to explore and apply advanced image analysis techniques to describe and predict the complex processes of flocculation and sedimentation in wastewater treatment processes with greater precision. This approach aims to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes while improving the predictive capacity of such systems. This research aims to contribute to the optimisation and efficiency of wastewater treatment technologies.
